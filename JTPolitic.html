					<img src="assets/politic1.jpg" class="featured-image" alt="PoliticHome1">
					<p>The Asian-American population in the state has doubled in two decades, and many live in the Atlanta suburbs, which voted for Joseph R. Biden Jr. by large margins.</p>
					<p>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. — Four years ago, Maliha Javed, an immigrant from Pakistan, was not paying attention to politics. A community college student in suburban Atlanta, she was busy paying for books and studying for classes. She did not vote that year.

But the past four years changed her. The Trump administration’s Muslim travel ban affected some of her friends. The child separation policy reminded her of living apart from her parents for three years during her own move to the United States. Then, this summer, the discovery that she was pregnant made it final: On Election Day, she marched into the Amazing Grace Lutheran Church near her house and voted for the first time in her life. She chose Joseph R. Biden Jr.

“I want it to be a better country for him to grow up in,” said Ms. Javed, who is 24 and is having a boy.

Ms. Javed is part of a small but powerful new force in Georgia politics: Asian-American voters. She lives in Gwinnett County, Georgia’s second-most populous county and the one with the largest Asian-American population. Mr. Biden, who narrowly defeated President Trump in Georgia, won Gwinnett County by 18 percentage points, a substantial increase over Hillary Clinton’s performance four years ago and only the second time the county went blue since the 1970s.</p>

					<img src="assets/Politic2.jpg" class="featured-image" alt="Politic2">
					<p>US President Donald Trump says he has authorised the GSA, the agency responsible for signing off on the presidential transition process, to begin "initial protocols" that will recognise Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election.

But the President also said his legal challenges over the election result would continue.</p>
					<p>The Department has received notice that pursuant to the Presidential Transition Act, the GSA Administrator is making certain post-election resources and services available to the Biden-Harris Transition Team. This evening, DOD has been contacted by the Biden-Harris team and their designated lead for the DOD Agency Review Team and, based on the ascertainment by the GSA Administrator, we will begin immediately implementing our plan to provide support in accordance with statute, DOD policy and the memorandum of agreement between the White House and the Biden-Harris team.  The DOD Transition Task Force will arrange and coordinate all DOD contact with the Biden-Harris team.  DOD is prepared to provide post-election services and support in a professional, orderly, and efficient manner that is befitting of the public’s expectation of the Department and our commitment to national security.</p>

					<img src="assets/Politic3.jpg" class="featured-image" alt="Politic3">
					<p>The General Elections Commission (KPU) has called off its plan to use an electronic vote recapitulation (e-recap) system to help determine the winners of the 2020 simultaneous regional elections following objections from lawmakers. The poll body failed last week to secure approval from lawmakers to issue a new KPU regulation to replace the manual recapitulation system with e-recap in all regions holding the Dec. 9 elections to help election authorities tally the final votes. Under the existing 2016 law on regional elections, the KPU is obliged to consult with House of Representatives Commission II overseeing home affairs in devising regulations. “Unfortunately, lawmakers did not approve our plan [to use the e-recap system for the elections],” KPU commissioner Evi Novida Ginting Manik said on Sunday</p>
